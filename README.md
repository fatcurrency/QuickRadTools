# QuickRadTools
A lightweight and easy-to-use toolkit for rapid implementation of medical image processing tasks, supporting common formats like DICOM/NIfTI and core operations such as visualization, preprocessing, and analysis.

## Project 1: PET-CT Medical Image Visualization and Fusion

This project focuses on the visualization and fusion of PET-CT medical images. It provides tools and code for loading, resampling, normalizing, and visualizing PET and CT images, including slice views and maximum intensity projections (MIP). The project also demonstrates how to align PET images to CT spatial coordinates, perform isotropic resampling, and create fused images for enhanced diagnostic analysis. The code is organized in a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to understand and extend for medical image processing and research applications.
